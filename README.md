<h1>DC/DC-5v-Converter</h1>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>

The DC/DC 5v converter project is aimed to create a simple and easy way to power a usb device. The primary focus was for this device to be able to power an Orange Pi off of a Rev Robotics PDH (Power Distribution Hub) for simple integration in a FRC Robot. This simple PCB board design was used to deepen understanding of circit design, PCB layout, and power electronics.

<h2>Skills Learned:</h2>

-PCB Board Design and Layout  
-How to Utilize Bypass Capacitors  
-understanding of component selection  

<h2>Tools Used:</h2>

-Kicad for PCB Layout and Design  
-Oscilloscope for analyzing noise and PCB trobleshooting
